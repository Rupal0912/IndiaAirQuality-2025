# Pollution Pulse: Mapping Indiaâ€™s Air Quality Snapshot

## Overview
This project analyzes air quality across India , using data from pollution control boards. It explores pollutant levels (PM2.5, NO2, etc.), maps hotspots, and proposes a simplified AQI.

## Objectives
1. Analyze pollutant distribution across cities/states.
2. Identify best/worst air quality regions.
3. Explore spatial patterns (North vs. South).
4. Assess pollutant variability.
5. Investigate pollutant correlations.
6. Map pollution hotspots.
7. Propose a city-level AQI.
8. Highlight potential pollution factors.

## Folder Structure
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebook for analysis.
- `datasets/`: Air quality data (raw and cleaned).
- `outputs/`: Plots and maps.
- `docs/`: Project report.

## Setup
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn folium scikit-learn
